# SongIndex

SongIndex is the first step in a process to connect listeners to songwriters through machine learning. The first step, which is designed to address the following problem:

> Can we build a machine learning model to connnect listeners, upon them providing a song title, and without prior listenership data, with songs they would enjoy?

I can cofirm we've been able to address this problem. 

## Methodology

Using cosine similarity, I analyzed roughly 22000 song titles utilizing their corresponding Audio Features and Audio Analysis obtained through the Spotify API, utilizing a Python wrapper aptly named Spotipy. Every song was ~rated~ on its similarity with the other recordings through criteria including, energy, danceability, ... a full list of which can be found in the TK notebook and data dictionary file.

## Updates to Come

In the near future, I plan on adding a number of 

- Web interface to query API for recommendations
- Incorporate songwriter credits into the model

Eventually, I plan on revamping the recommender entirely, into the aforementioned tool to connect listeners with songwriters. The idea of the model being two-fold (and therefore made up of two different models):

- Given a song, recommend songwriters whom write similarly to how the song in question was written
- Recommend the songwriter's works which sound most like the original song submitted
