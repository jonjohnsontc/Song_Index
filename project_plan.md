# Songwriter Graph - 90 day-ish project plan
- Concluding on 3/31/2020

## Outline: Things I'd Like to do:
- Test performance of analysis sorter through different means
- Add pre-processed data for model into database
- Create new dataset for modeling
- Create ANN model
- Test several variations to ANN
- Contribute to "Semi-Exhaustive Analysis of Nearest Neighbor Approaches"
- Re-create development environment to better reflect what I'm working with
- Consider using poetry, and leveraging the pyproject.toml file for requirements
- Add unit tests
  - analysis_sorter
- Clean up repository 
  - Get rid of old .py files
- (Maybe) add raw song files to some sort of data lake or warehouse
- Build site using Flask
- Launch website

## Step-by-Step Plan
- 1/18 - 1/25: Test performance of analysis sorter / Create unit tests for analysis sorter elements
- 1/26 - 2/1: Build database for the pre-processed data + Create ANN model
