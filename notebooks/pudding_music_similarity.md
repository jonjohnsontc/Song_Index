# The Gist

This paper examines the musical similarity of #1 Billboard hits with one another, both within the same era, and across all eras.

> The musical differences among hits on the Hot 100 is trending downward.
> The result is a trend toward similarity, with smaller distances among songs. To date, songs that charted between 2012 and 2016 were the most similar, according to EchoNest data.

John Seabrook, staff writer for The New Yorker posits this:

> “What I see,” he said, “is the enormous, quick but large scale shift from the kind of craft-like song-making process of people putting together lyrics and melody in a semi-organic setting to what I call the track-and-hook method.”

> In the late 80s, the most-common songwriting team consisted of two people, and only 7 songs had more than 3 writers. Today, well over half of songs are written by 4 or more people. Songs with over 10 songwriters are increasingly more common: “Uptown Funk” and “Havana” had 11 songwriters each. With songwriting by committee, one can imagine each individual’s musical quirks are “averaged out,” producing a less unique sound.
