# Schedule of Tasks

## To-Dos:
- Assign index number to each artist name and song title in your database
  - Check out Douglases example code in his boardgame notebook for ideas in indexing
  - Basically creating lookup tables for my track and artist info

1. 9/29 - Finish cleaning RIAA Artist Table
2. 9/29 - Refrencing the RIAA table, query 'Spotipy' for recording metadata of the top 25 songs for each artist.
   - Depending on the success of #2. I will also consider retreiving the Top-10 recordings of each artist,
as it's very easy to do this programmatically, and will almost assuredly have a better match rate.
